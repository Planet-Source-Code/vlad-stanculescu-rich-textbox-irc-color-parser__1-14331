### Description

The purpose of this code is to easily allow you to add color to a richtextbox if you are making an IRC client.

I am currently in the process of writing an IRC client and I have had people telling me it's hard.. so I made my own color parser, it does not support backgrounds.

Anyway, it works and I am going to make use of it, you could too, it supports 7 colors defined just like irc through character 3-31-2-15.
